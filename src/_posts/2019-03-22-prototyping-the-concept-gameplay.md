<p><font size="6">I was hiking</font> with friends in Alaska on a multi-use trail (we were on foot, but there were also people on off-road vehicles), when we suddenly encountered a black bear about 30 feet in front of us.</p>

<br>
<p>We followed the correct protocols and slowly backed away. While anxiously waiting for the bear to leave, I heard the faint sound of an ATV in the distance coming towards us on the trail. In that heightened emotional state, my immediate thought was <b>"$#%@#, the bear commandeered an ATV and is coming for us"</b>. I became infatuated with that mental image of a 500 lb beast hurling towards me at 60 mph on a metal death machine.</p>

<h2>I Couldn't Bear It</h2>

<p>I have always wanted to create a release a complete video game, and the concept was right in front me. I am a professional software developer, so naturally I prioritize the programming and gameplay. What is the first step in materializing this concept? What is the simplest problem I can solve right away? It all starts with a wheel.<br>

<p>I am an avid Linux user who loves open-source software, which led me to choose <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> and <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/introducing-csharp-godot">C#</a> to target a 2D sidescroller. I read through the docs, experimented a lot, and ultimately implemented my own "Wheel" mechanics against arbitrary polygons. It looks and feels like one wheel of an ATV&mdash;one problem solved, one concept materialized. And once you have one wheel, <a href="https://github.com/ludditegames/bears_on_atvs/releases/tag/v0.0.2-alpha">why not two?</a> Why not <a href="https://github.com/ludditegames/bears_on_atvs/releases/tag/v0.0.3-alpha">put a "Bear" on this "ATV"</a>? Why not add a camera and checkpoints?</p>

<h2>"Implying Video Games Are for Fun"</h2>

<p>Mechanics aren't everything. What makes this concept of a bear on an ATV so infatuating? What makes good video games fun? Two of my favorite games come to mind: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari_Damacy">Katamari Damacy</a>. Sonic sprints through levels are high speeds, shoots off ramps, gets flung aprings and powerups. And Katamari? There's something satisfying about menacing a virtual society in such a silly way.</p>

<div class="github-link"><h3>v0.0.8-alpha: <b><a href="https://github.com/ludditegames/bears_on_atvs/releases/tag/v0.0.8-alpha">Speedboosts, Food, Enemies <img src="/assets/github_64_noborder.png"></a></b></h3></div>

<p>Bears need a lot of calories a day. A lot. Why not have have food be the in-game point system? Why not run over enemies to kill them? Or swat at them with your big bear paws? Why not have speed boosts to <i>really</i> shoot you off a ramp or loop? None of these concepts are perfect, and will probably get updated in this game's development cycle. But each iterative development starts to paint a more complete picture. I haven't made a single serious sprite or graphic yet, but I can <i>see</i> these concepts in action. I can see what works, what is fun, what is ultimately possible.</p>

<h2>Just Getting Started</h2>

<p>I am brand new to game development, and I am having a lot of fun. But there is a <i>lot</i> of work to do. I will continue to prototype out this concept iteratively, slowly materializing this concept.</p>
