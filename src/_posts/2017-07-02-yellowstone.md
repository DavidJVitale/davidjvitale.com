The final stop on our trip was the Tetons and Yellowstone national park in Wyoming. The trip was a mix of geysers, wildlife, and water falls. Above you see the valley near artist point.

We saw the Old Faithful Geyser go off a few times, and the Grand Geyser go off once (it was huge!).

We had potentially wanted to do a bit more on our trip, but after Yellowstone we decided to drive back to Maquoketa, IA to hang out with Isaac's family at the Codfish Hollow Barnstormer. Yellowstone was our last stop, and I forgot to write my last blog post. This is the last group picture we took from our incredible trip.
