Leaving for the trip today, Kevin Isaac Joey and I are driving to Badlands, South Dakota. We'll spend the day there tomorrow, then make our way to Glacier, Montana.

Today we picked everyone up from their respective homes, packed all of our stuff into my newly purchased Rav4. After racking up $100 food bill from Walmart, we're spending all of today driving. Really looking forward seeing South Dakota and Montana!
