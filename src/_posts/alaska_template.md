Today is travel day to Glacier. We slept in Wyoming with great stars (Kevin got a good long exposure of the sky). Yesterday we did some stuff after Badlands in Black Hills, the National forest with Mt Rushmore.

We were at Mt Rushmore for the 15 seconds of a stoplight. Thank God for zoom lenses.

We then climbed Harney Peak/Black Elk Peak, the tallest point East of the Rockies! Here's a view from the lookout tower.

There was a driving wilderness highway with Donkeys, Bison, etc. Here's a cool donkey we had a staredownwith.

Finally, we saw Bison up close. They are massive! And they have cute babies that look just like dogs. It was a great experience.  Have one more picture of baby Bison:
