Got to Glacier this morning. The road was closed halfway through since it's technically the off season, so we had to drive around the whole park to get through.

Saw some waterfalls and Mary's Lake, which holds Wild Goose Island (not the beer). We're driving to the other part of the park, so hopefully I get Internet to get this post to go through. Enjoy some pics if it does go through!
