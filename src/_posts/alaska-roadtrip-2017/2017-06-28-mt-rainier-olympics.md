Look at the mountain range reflected in the marmot's eye!

We spent a night in Olympic National Park at Flapjack lakes. The water was so clear, and the forest was awesome. I'd previously only been to the mountains of the Olympics before, so it was cool to see in person how diverse the giant park is.

We also did Mt. Rainier National Park. It was like 70-80 but so snowy because of how high we were! We sled down on a big snowy Hill on our butts, which was a definite highlight. We got some awesome views and had a great time.

Next is a lot of things in Oregon! Then the Teton's, Yellowstone, and some various stuff in South Dakota.
