Spent the last 2 days in Banff! At first we were a bit upset at how commercialized it was, but we quickly learned to appreciate the awesome nature past the shops and tourists. There's some great back country too, this place is pretty great.

We finally took the canoe off the roof rack and floated on a small lake! All four of us fit on the 14 foot three seater. It was great.

It was also cool because there was still snow on some lakes and mountains even though it was 70-80 degrees out. We even did a mountain climb day hike where we were walking over 3-4 feet deep in snow! An interesting experience for sure.

Enjoy all the pictures taken!
