Today is travel day to Glacier. We slept in Wyoming with great stars (Kevin got a good long exposure of the sky, I got this moon photo). Yesterday we did some stuff after Badlands in Black Hills, the National forest with Mt Rushmore.

We were at Mt Rushmore for the 15 seconds of a stoplight. Thank God for zoom lenses.

We then climbed Harney Peak/Black Elk Peak, the tallest point East of the Rockies! Here's a view from the lookout tower.

There was a driving wilderness highway with Donkeys, Bison, etc. Here's a cool donkey we had a staredownwith.

Finally, we saw Bison up close. They are massive! And they have cute babies that look just like dogs. It was a great experience.  Have one more picture of baby Bison:
