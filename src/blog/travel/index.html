<h1>Travel</h1>

<p>I am a nature junkie who loves hiking, camping, and vibing. Check out some of the places I've been too:</p>

<h3>Alaska Roadtrip</h2>

<p>After I graduated college, I went on a 6 week epic road trip to Alaska with some great friends. After lots of beans, not a lot of showers, and 16k miles put on my trusty Rav4ioli, we had quite a few stories to tell. You can read all about it <a href="./alaska-roadtrip/">here</a>.

<h3>Northern California Roadtrip</h2>

<p>I currently reside in Southern California. A few good friends and I decided to drive up the whole state, stopping at Yosemite, Lassen Volcanic, Crater Lake, and Redwoods National Park. Read more about that epic trip <a href="./norcal-roadtrip/">here</a>.</p> 

<h3>More to come!</h3>

<p>I have traveled a lot, but haven't written much about it. This blog is under construction, and I hope to update it soon with more exciting stories: stay tuned!</p>
