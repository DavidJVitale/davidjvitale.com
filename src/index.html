<h3>Blog</h3>

<p>I am a very amateur photographer who mainly takes pictures of the nature I travel to. To view my photos, click <a href="./photography/">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Tech</h3>

<p>I am a Software Engineer who is very aware of the horrible technology and practices used to implement this website: I promise it will get better in the future! I have a <a href="https://github.com/DavidJVitale/">GitHub</a> that sort of proves that I am aware of technology created after 2003.</p>
