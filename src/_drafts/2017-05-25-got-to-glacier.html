Got to Glacier this morning. The road was closed halfway through since it's technically the off season, so we had to drive around the whole park to get through. <br /><br />Saw some waterfalls and Mary's Lake, which holds Wild Goose Island (not the beer). We're driving to the other part of the park, so hopefully I get Internet to get this post to go through. Enjoy some pics if it does go through!
