In the winter of 2016, I did an overnight backpacking adventure with my great friends in Big Bend National Park in South Texas. It was a great experience I have very fond memories of.

We spent the first day on the trail making our way towards the Rio Grande river. The river water can't be filtered, and there were no water sources on this trail. This meant we had to carry all of our water in our packs, which was pretty heavy.

We slept out overnight right next to the Rio Grade river, a stone's throw away from Mexico. Very cool experience.
