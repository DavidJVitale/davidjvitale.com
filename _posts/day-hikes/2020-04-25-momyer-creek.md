Joining us for this day hike are great friends Indhu, Zach, Rebecca, and Alex. And ofcourse we can't forget my dog Nali and our new friend Toast!

Highly recommend this hike in the Spring in Southern California. It hovers at ~7k feet elevation -- this means a cool escape from the heat, but no snow to deal with. This hike started out as a fun creek crossing, followed by an intense 3 miles uphill. Plenty of shade, beautiful forests, and amazing views. I hope to come back here in the Summer and go all the way up to San Bernadino Peak!

This hike was also a much-needed escape from our lives in quarantine. We practiced social distancing from all other hikers. I am very fortunate to have such great friends to hike with, thanks a bunch guys! :)
