Random camping trip near Bishop CA with Indhu, Sam, Olivia, Zack, and Vish.

This area is beautiful, great for hiking and fishing. We camped nearby at "Four Jeffrey" campground, spend Saturday and Sunday hiking. The only complaint was that we were eaten alive by misquitos.

Our hike culminated in a refreshing jump into Donkey Lake. It was so freezing cold, we didn't stay in for long!

While Sam and I nervously psyched ourselves into doing a standard dive/jump from the somewhat tall rock, Zack absolutely crushed it with the non-hesitant perfect flip. The stuff of legends, I'm still impressed.
