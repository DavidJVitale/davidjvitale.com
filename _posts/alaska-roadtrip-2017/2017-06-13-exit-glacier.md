After our intense Denali trip, we spent a few days with Isaac's uncle Luke and his girlfriend Jonni who live a bit outside of Homer, AK. They fed us so much food (I was eating something besides Granola!!), let us crash in their living room, and took us fishing (no luck, sadly). It was a great refuel stop that we definitely needed, their hospitality was greatly appreciated!

Next we hit up the Exit Glacier in Kenai Fjords National Park. It was just a day hike, but we got some really cool views of the Exit Glacier. Enjoy the pictures!

 Next, we're driving to Wrangell National Park, near the AK/Canada border. That's our last stop in Alaska (everything else cool you need an airplane), but then we have lots of plans in Vancouver, Washington state, Oregon, Idaho, and Wyoming! Stay tuned!
