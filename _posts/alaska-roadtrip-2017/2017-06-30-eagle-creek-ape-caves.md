Our Oregon plans got changed due to a recommendation of some trail buddies we met in Olympic: thanks Jeff and Peter! It was definitely some awesome recommendations. 

We did a lot of waterfalls in Oregon: Eagle Creek has a lot, including Punch Bowl Falls. We swam in the freezing water, then went to a waterfall that you walk behind. We also briefly saw Multnomah Falls. All of it was super cool, Oregon has such a cool mixture of forests and elevation changes, I love it there.

Next we did Ape Caves, just back over the Washington Oregon border near Mt St Helen's. This was a cave formed by a week of lava flow a few thousand years ago.  Most caves form over millions of years of water erosion, so this was definitely an amazing experience. 

Next on the trip is Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons!
